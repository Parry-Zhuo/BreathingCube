/**
 * @file Ws212bDriver.h
 * @brief Driver for controlling WS2812B LEDs using PWM and DMA.
 *
 * This driver generates a PWM signal to communicate with WS2812B LEDs in NZR communication mode.
 * The PWM signal is designed to have a frequency of 800 kHz with specific duty cycles to represent
 * the digital '0' and '1' bits required by the WS2812B protocol.
 *
 * ## Clock Configuration and PWM Generation
 *
 * - Desired PWM frequency: 800 kHz (Period = 1.25 Âµs)
 * - Clock frequency (f_clk): 64 MHz
 * - to send 0: Send PWM T0L - 0.85us , T0H - 0.4us
 * - to send 1: Send PWM T1L - 0.45us , T1H - 0.8us
 * - reset set LOW at 0.5us > T > 280us
 *
 *
 *
 * To achieve the desired frequency, the prescaler (PSC) and auto-reload register (ARR) values
 * are calculated as follows:
 *
 * - The timer frequency is determined by the formula:
 *   - Timer Frequency = Clock Frequency / [(PSC + 1) * (ARR + 1)]
 * - Given the clock frequency of 64 MHz and the desired PWM frequency of 800 kHz:
 *   - The optimal values are:
 *     - PSC (Prescaler) = 0
 *     - ARR (Auto-Reload Register) = 79
 *
 * These values ensure the PWM signal operates at an exact frequency of 800 kHz.
 *
 * These values ensure that the PWM frequency is precisely 800 kHz.
 *
 * ## Duty Cycle Configuration
 *
 * - The WS2812B protocol requires specific duty cycles to represent '0' and '1':
 *   - '0' bit: ~33.3% duty cycle (1/3)
 *   - '1' bit: ~66.6% duty cycle (2/3)
 * - The corresponding capture/compare register (CCR) values for these duty cycles are:
 *   - CCR for 1/3 duty cycle: 27
 *   - CCR for 2/3 duty cycle: 53
 *
 * These settings allow the driver to generate the correct PWM signals to control the LEDs.
 *
 * @note This driver uses DMA1 for efficient data transfer to the LEDs.
