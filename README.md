This is a project where I created a meditation timer. 

Manufactured 4 Layer PCB with standard signal-gnd-pwr-signal layers.
Communicated with manufacturer to get PCB made.

Starting with hardware, where I created a PCB containing an STM32 as well as basic power circuitry and layout of different buses to communicate with different devices via I2C.
